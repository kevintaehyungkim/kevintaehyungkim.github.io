			<h3>Orange County Youth Symphony Orchestra (September 2011 - May 2013)</h3>
			<p>The mission of the Orange County Youth Symphony Orchestra is to provide pre-professional training to Orange Countyâ€™s most talented young musicians through varied performance opportunities, and by establishing an environment that develops creative ability, self-expression and the desire for perfection. I participated in the orchestra from 2011 to 2013, participating in several performances and concerts in Southern California, and most notably taking part in the "Concert for Fifth Graders" series hosted by the Philharmonic Society, which aims to provide free musical education to underprivileged students around California. Check out some of our performances here!</p>
