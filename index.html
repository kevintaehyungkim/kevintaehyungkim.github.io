		<h2>Work Experience</h2>
		
		<h3>iOS Development Intern @ Waller Lab</h3>
		<p>May 2016 - August 2016</p>
		<p> Implemented openCV framework and conducted performance comparisons for 		CellScope mobile microscopy applications at Waller Lab, UC Berkeley. Application produces higher resolution images from raw pixel data acquired in mobile device by the CellScope microscope via Bluetooth. </p>

		<h3>CS 61B Lab Assistant @ UC Berkeley</h3>
		<p>August 2015 - May 2016</p>
		<p> Responsible for assisting students in grasping key concepts of data 		structures, sorting algorithms, runtimes, and basic software engineering 		concepts, as well as answering project or lab-related questions. </p>

		<h3>Software Development Intern @ Hyundai Capital America</h3>
		<p>May - June 2015</p>
		<p> Assisted the transition from manual check sampling to an electronic auditing system. Expedited the audit procedure through more efficient check sampling, lease and retail void processing, and flat cancel and re-book tracking. </p>
		
		<h3>Research Assistant @ University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine</h3>
		<p>June - August 2015</p>
		<p>Research assistant under Dr. Keigo Machida in a microbiology/immunology 		laboratory studying molecular oncogenesis, the mechanism of carcinogenesis through cancer stem cells, using mouse models associated with the hepatitis virus.</p>

		<h2>Academic and Personal Projects</h2>
		
		<h3>Distance-Vector Routing (October 2016)</h3>
		<p>(Python) Utilizes learning switches and distance-vector routers to transport packets to destinations efficiently while accounting for dynamic network topology updates. Implements features similar to Routing Information Protocol. </p>

		<h3>Chat (September 2016)</h3>
		<p> (Python) Created a chat server via the Python socket library that allows users to converse in different channels. Clients can create/join different channels, and messages are relayed to all other members of a particular channel. </p>
		
		<h3>AudioPractice (September 2016 - Present)</h3>
		<p> (Swift, Objective-C) Developing an iOS application designed to help dancers practice more efficiently through tempo and pitch control, markers to loop particular sections of music, and basic mixing of soundtracks. </p>

		<h3>HARBOR on Apache Hadoop (April 2016)</h3>
		<p> (Java) Given an abundance of page requests, matched request/reply pairs to construct Query Focused Dataset objects that were ultimately serialized into Hadoop File System. </p>

		<h3>Git Version Control System (July 2015)</h3>
		<p> Created a smaller version of the Git control system that mimics certain features such as: add, commit, branch, checkout, merge, rebase, log. Coded in Java.</p>

		<h3>Checkers (July 2015)</h3>
		<p>Created a two-player game of Checkers with a slight twist by introducing two new pieces: Bomb and Shield. Coded in Java, with implementations of the StdDraw library from Princeton University.</p>

		<h3>Scheme Interpreter (November 2014)</h3>
		<p>Created a program that parses/reads code written in Scheme and evaluates the code recursively. Coded in Python.</p>
